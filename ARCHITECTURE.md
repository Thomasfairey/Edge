## Web App vs Backend: Why Both Exist

The repository contains two server-side codebases that serve different deployment targets:

- **`the-edge/`** is the reference **Next.js web app** deployed on **Vercel**. It uses Next.js API routes for all AI calls (lesson, roleplay, debrief, mission, etc.) and serves the full session UI. This is the primary development surface and the fastest way to iterate on the product.

- **`backend/`** is a dedicated **Hono/TypeScript API server** designed for the **native iOS app**. It provides versioned REST endpoints (`/v1/session/*`), Supabase Auth integration, and is intended to run on a long-lived Node.js host. The iOS app communicates exclusively with this backend.

**Why not share a single backend?** The two apps are separately deployable and have different operational requirements (Vercel serverless functions vs. persistent Node.js process). The web app benefits from Next.js SSR, edge middleware, and zero-config deployment. The native app needs a stable, versioned API contract with auth middleware that issues JWTs.

**Content duplication:** Characters (`lib/characters.ts` vs `backend/src/content/characters.ts`) and concepts (`lib/concepts.ts` vs `backend/src/content/concepts.ts`) are intentionally duplicated across both codebases. This is a deliberate trade-off: the two apps may diverge as the iOS app ships features on a different cadence, and coupling them through a shared package would complicate independent deployment.

**Keeping content in sync:** When curriculum changes (new concepts, updated character archetypes, scoring rubric adjustments), both codebases should be updated in the same PR where practical. A quick diff between `the-edge/lib/` and `backend/src/content/` will surface any drift.

### ⚠️ Known divergence: `backend/` and `ios/` are behind

As of the life-contexts reframe (July 2026), `the-edge/` and `backend/` have **deliberately** diverged, and the drift is expected rather than a bug to be fixed opportunistically. `the-edge/` alone received:

- **Life contexts** replacing the `professional | social | both` track model. `backend/` still speaks the track vocabulary.
- **Curriculum and cast expansion** — 50 → 76 concepts, 9 → 32 characters, five new relational domains. `backend/src/content/` still holds the original 50 and 9.
- **Context-specific scoring dimensions.** `the-edge/` stores scores as JSONB keyed by a per-context dimension set; `backend/` and the native app are pinned to the original five-column rubric (`technique_application`, `tactical_awareness`, `frame_control`, `emotional_regulation`, `strategic_outcome`).
- **Generated scenarios** and **variable session shapes**, neither of which exists in the native flow.

The native SwiftUI app (`ios/TheEdge/Models/Domain.swift`) hardcodes the five original score keys and `SessionFlowView` assumes the fixed five-phase order, so it cannot consume the new ledger shape without changes of its own.

**The `ledger` table is now shaped for `the-edge/`.** The five `score_*` columns are gone. Any `backend/` code reading them will fail against the current schema — that is the sharp edge to know about before picking the native app back up.

**Before resuming native app work,** decide whether to port the context model across or to fork the schema. Do not treat the differences above as drift to be quietly reconciled; they are a product decision that `the-edge/` made and `backend/` has not.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Backend: Hono on Node.js

**Why Hono over Express/Fastify:**
- TypeScript-first with excellent type inference
- Middleware composition is cleaner and type-safe
- Built-in streaming support (critical for roleplay)
- ~6x faster than Express in benchmarks
- Lightweight (~14KB), fast cold starts
- Compatible with multiple runtimes (Node, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, Vercel)

### 2. Authentication: Supabase Auth

**Why Supabase Auth:**
- Already using Supabase for database — unified platform
- Built-in Apple Sign-In support (App Store requirement)
- Email/password + social auth out of the box
- JWT tokens that work with Row-Level Security
- Free tier generous enough for MVP

### 3. Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase with RLS

**Row-Level Security ensures:**
- Every query is automatically scoped to the authenticated user
- No data leaks between users even if application code has bugs
- Backend uses service role for admin operations only

### 4. iOS: SwiftUI + MVVM + Swift Concurrency

**Why native over cross-platform:**
- Best possible performance and feel for App Store
- Native haptics, animations, push notifications
- StoreKit 2 integration is Swift-only
- SwiftUI + async/await is the modern standard
- Apple favours native apps in review

### 5. API Design: RESTful with Versioning

**Endpoints follow:**
- `POST /v1/auth/signup` — Create account
- `POST /v1/auth/login` — Sign in
- `POST /v1/auth/apple` — Apple Sign-In
- `GET  /v1/status` — Dashboard data
- `POST /v1/session/checkin` — Phase 0
- `POST /v1/session/lesson` — Phase 1 (streaming)
- `POST /v1/session/roleplay` — Phase 2 (streaming)
- `POST /v1/session/coach` — /coach command
- `POST /v1/session/retrieval` — Retrieval bridge (active recall gate)
- `POST /v1/session/debrief` — Phase 3
- `POST /v1/session/mission` — Phase 4
- `GET  /v1/profile` — User profile
- `PUT  /v1/profile` — Update profile
- `POST /v1/subscription/verify` — Verify App Store receipt
- `GET  /v1/subscription/status` — Subscription status

---

## Database Schema v2

### Key Changes from v1:
1. **Users table** — replaces hardcoded profile
2. **RLS on all tables** — per-user data isolation
3. **Sessions table** — track session lifecycle
4. **Subscription tracking** — tier management
5. **Proper foreign keys and constraints**

See `backend/src/db/migrations/` for full SQL.

## Scoring Calibration Strategy

### Problem: Scores feel arbitrary
Current approach relies on AI to self-calibrate, which produces inconsistent results.

### Solution: Rubric-anchored scoring with exemplars

Each score level (1-5) per dimension gets:
1. **Explicit behavioral criteria** — what the user must demonstrate
2. **Example transcript excerpts** — showing what a 2 vs 4 looks like
3. **Relative scoring** — compare to user's own baseline (rolling average)
4. **Citation requirement** — AI must quote the specific turn justifying each score

### Implementation:
- Scoring rubric embedded in debrief prompt
- Self-assessment step added before AI debrief (builds metacognition)
- Score variance tracking — flag sessions where scores jump >2 points

---

## Content Variety Strategy

### Problem: Sessions feel repetitive after ~10 days

### Solution: Dynamic scenario composition

1. **Expand characters** to 12+ archetypes
2. **Scenario mutations** — same character, different contexts/stakes
3. **Difficulty progression** — adaptive based on rolling scores
4. **User weakness targeting** — scenarios that probe identified weak spots
5. **Character personality randomisation** — vary traits within archetype bounds
